Main concept: Game based on old school Donkey Kong, with a twist of our own creativity.
DonkeyZilla brings to life an imaginary world where a monster (DonkeyZilla) kidnaps a princess and threatens to destroy the world.
All hope remains in the hands of our player, a brave warrior that should save our princess and the world itself.
